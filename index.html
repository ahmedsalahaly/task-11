            <p style="font-size: small;">Nov. 30, 2021</p>

            <p>Megan Searfoss has been hoarding sneakers in Connecticut.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Ms. Searfoss, the owner of two running stores in Darien and<br> Ridgefield, Conn., would 
            normally have about 3,000 pairs of<br> shoes in stock ahead of the holiday season. 
            But as she watched<br> supply chain concerns in Vietnam mount this summer and into<br> the fall, 
            she secured a new storage facility and is now carrying<br> around 4,100 pairs.</p>
            <br>

            <p>It’s a costly gamble for Ms. Searfoss, who said she was extended<br> about $165,000 more 
            than she would typically be in November<br> because of worries about potential shortages.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“It’s placing a big bet and anticipating that what all the analysts are<br> saying is correct,” 
            Ms. Searfoss said. “Usually, we get through the<br> New York City Marathon and then we stop buying
            shoes — we sell<br> off what we have and go into January super, super lean. But we’re<br> being told 
            not to do that because there’s just not going to be any shoes.”</p>
            <br>

            <p>The buildup of running shoes in Connecticut is just one example of how<br> supply chain woes and 
            pandemic-related shortages are affecting thousands<br> of small businesses around the United States 
            this holiday season. While the<br> widespread availability of vaccines is translating into a busier 
            shopping<br> season than last year, businesses of all sizes are grappling with the impact<br> from 
            <a class="factory" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/29/business/supply-chain-vietnam.html">
            factory shutdowns</a> overseas, backups <a class="atports" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11
            /business/supply-chain-crisis-savannah-port.html">at ports</a> , and trucking and other<br> labor 
            shortages.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The unpredictability this year has forced many small businesses to make buying<br> decisions months 
            or weeks earlier than they normally would and to tie up more<br> of their cash in inventory, which 
            can be risky.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“The big thing is you really have to order in advance,” said Dan Quinn, an owner<br> of 
            <a class="whatwemake" href="https://www.wwmake.com/">What We Make</a> , a furniture business in Algonquin, 
            Ill., which sells tables and<br> other wares through Etsy. “I’ve got 14 weeks of projects. I need to get 
            most of that<br> material in house as fast as possible and keep buying it until you have a stockpile <br> 
            basically.”</p>
            <br>

            <p>While many small businesses are affected by manufacturing issues overseas, some<br> have used this moment 
            to their advantage. Etsy, which powers online stores for<br> millions of sellers, said more than half of its 
            U.S. vendors sourced materials from<br> within their own states, allowing them to bypass many of the supply 
            chain problems<br> that are affecting the global economy.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Etsy stores “don’t have the complex supply chains that are vulnerable to single points<br> of failure,” 
            Josh Silverman, Etsy’s chief executive, said in an interview.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Still, the range of shortages can manifest themselves in unusual ways.</p>7
            <br>

            <p>Isabel Amigon, owner of the online store Sololi, is still waiting on an order of Christmas<br> tree 
            ornaments she placed in April. The manufacturer alerted her that the order would be<br> delayed because 
            of a shortage in strings to tie on top of the decorated orbs.</p>
            <br>

                <p>Ms. Amigon, who is based in Westchester County, N.Y., said she was worried that if she<br> didn’t 
                get it in time for the holiday season, she would have to wait until next year to make<br> use of the 
                inventory. The string shortage has also led her to remove specific home goods<br> items from her website, 
                such as table runners and washcloths.</p>
                <br>

                <p>“Even if I get them by the end of November, I won’t be able to sell all of them because<br> most people 
                have already bought their ornaments,” Ms. Amigon said. “I placed the orders<br> early, and I still have to 
                face this situation.”</p>
                <br>

                <p>Other missing items are more traditional than string.</p>
                <br>

                <p class="some">“Some things we ordered in June and July are still coming in,” Sean Arnold, an owner of 
                Playmatters Toys, said.<br>Credit...Angelo Merendino for The New York Times</p>
                <br>

                <p>Earlier this year, Angela and Sean Arnold were planning to order another set of Disney<br> princess 
                dolls to fill some shelves in their toy store, Playmatters Toys, in Pepper Pike, Ohio.<br> 
                But they got a notification in September from the distributor alerting them and other toy store<br> 
                owners that the items were “indefinitely out of stock” because a Covid-19 outbreak had shut<br> down 
                the factory in Vietnam where the dolls were manufactured.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Even though they anticipated shipping delays and ordered some toys in mid-May instead of<br> August, 
                they could not get ahead of the global disruption.</p>
                <br>

                <p>And it’s not only dolls. The couple has been missing out on other toys and electronics because<br> of 
                shipping delays or disruptions in manufacturing plants in Vietnam. The couple has also been<br> forced 
                to raise prices on some products because of higher transportation and wholesale costs<br> from toy vendors.</p>
                <br>

                <p>“Some things we ordered in June and July are still coming in,” Mr. Arnold said.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Because of these kind of delays, Etsy has viewed this moment as one in which small businesses<br> can provide 
                gift options that are not reliant on overseas factories and shipping. Extra consumer<br> interest in small 
                businesses, whether online or offline, would more likely be welcome after the<br> pandemic dealt 
                <a class="crippling" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/business/smallbusiness/small-business-start-ups-entrepeneurs.html">
                crippling blow</a> a to so many last year.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Etsy said it had seen searches for living room furniture soar by 1,572 percent and less drastic<br> but 
                significant jumps for dining tables, checkers or chess boards, suggesting that some shoppers<br> are coming to 
                the site rather than going to chain stores.</p>
                <br>

                <img class="girl" src="Image/merlin_197685165_461f3374-e9f1-472f-9a66-10e042d1b9c1-superJumbo.jpg"

                <p class="Jeannine">Jeannine Cook, a bookstore owner, said customers had canceled orders because publishers 
                had trouble delivering<br> books.Credit...Mark Makela for The New York Times</p>
                <br>

                <p>Etsy learned how to better handle large surges in demand after face masks exploded as<br> a category on 
                the site during the onset of the pandemic, and it has made improvements<br> designed to mitigate shipping 
                issues it experienced then. Mr. Silverman said that now,<br> virtually all items from sellers in the United 
                States had an expected delivery date, which<br> was not the case a year ago, and shoppers can filter products 
                by geography to shop from<br> vendors in their area, which can help accelerate shipping.</p>
                <br>

                <p>The company also said it checked in with sellers to ensure they had enough raw materials<br> and supplies 
                when its technology observed jumps in demand for specific items.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Mr. Quinn, the owner of the furniture seller What We Make, has seen his business boom as<br> Americans 
                grapple with long wait times and lack of availability for furniture from chains.<br> Customers have been willing 
                to wait 10 weeks for a dining table from him, particularly after<br> 20-week waits at chains like West Elm.</p>
                <br>

                <p>“The big-box stores don’t have a lot of things they normally have, so the positive for us is that<br> people are 
                sort of forced to look at other options whereas before they’d settle for the simplest<br> option,” he said.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Still, he has seen his business disrupted in other ways, including a sharp increase in material prices<br> 
                and a scramble for reclaimed wood, which typically comes from old barns.</p>
                <br>

                <p>“The people who take down the barns for the material we use, a lot of them ended up getting laid off<br> or 
                going on unemployment,” Mr. Quinn said. “So we have had to try to stockpile material and order<br> well in advance 
                of what we used to do.”</p>

                <br>

                <p>While Mr. Quinn has been thriving in spite of competition from major furniture sellers,<br> the country’s 
                biggest retailers are often better equipped to handle supply chain issues than<br> small businesses. Companies 
                like Walmart and Amazon are massive enough that they can<br> charter airplanes to obtain certain goods.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Jeannine Cook doesn’t have that luxury. Ms. Cook, the owner of Harriett’s Bookshop in<br> Philadelphia, noticed 
                during the summer that publishers were having trouble delivering her<br> book orders, with some unable to even 
                provide a timeline for when orders would arrive.<br> The problem became more widespread in late August.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Ms. Cook, who opened a second location in Collingswood, N.J., in July, said more customers<br> were canceling 
                their orders from the bookshop.</p>
                <br>

                <p>“It makes me nervous because I don’t want folks to feel like they can’t get what they need or<br> want,” Ms. 
                Cook said. “It’s hard because we’re already up against the big-box companies that<br> have so much more infrastructure 
                than we do.”</p>

                <p>A recent study by Adobe showed that out-of-stock messages in October more than quadrupled<br> compared with 
                October 2019. That’s one reason that the retail industry, including small<br> businesses, has urged the public to 
                shop early this year to secure gifts for the holiday season.</p>
                <br>

                <p>“I hate that we have now gone right from Halloween to Christmas,” said Ms. Searfoss, the<br> proprietor of the 
                running stores, who said she began holiday marketing on Nov. 1 for the first<br> time. “I don’t want people to feel 
                frantic, but I do think it’s pretty serious that they’re not going<br> to get what they want this year.”</p>
                <br>

                <p>She anticipated that shipping delays and out-of-stock issues at bigger chains might drive business<br> to her stores. 
                “People, those days before Christmas, will be buying whatever they can from whatever<br> local store they can,” 
                she said.</p>
                <br>

                <p>“It’s just a little bit stressful for me, thinking, ‘OK, look at all that I’ve bought,’” Ms. Searfoss said.<br> 
                “If I buy it, will they come?”</p>
